# CSC430 Project Repository

This repository contains projects that demonstrate the learning and practice of advanced programming concepts, such as data structures, memory management, and file systems. The following projects are included:

- [CSC430 Project Repository](#csc430-project-repository)
  - [LinkedList](#linkedlist)
  - [FatReader](#fatreader)
  - [MemoryManager](#memorymanager)
  - [Team Members](#team-members)

During the development of these projects, we have learned crucial programming concepts and have gained hands-on experience in implementing complex data structures and algorithms.

## [LinkedList](https://github.com/aamindehkordi/CUI-Development-Operations/tree/main/Linked-List)

This project focuses on learning the C programming language and practicing collaborative development. We've implemented a simple linked list library, which includes essential operations, such as:

- CreateList
- AppendValue
- FindValue
- InsertBefore
- InsertAfter
- RemoveValue
- Sort
- PrintList
- PrintNode

Through this project, we have garnered valuable experience in working with pointers, memory allocation, and data manipulation.

## [FatReader](https://github.com/aamindehkordi/CUI-Development-Operations/tree/main/Fat-Reader)

This project dives into file systems, specifically working with the File Allocation Table (FAT) format. We have learned the structure of FAT file systems and developed a FAT reader with useful functions, including:

- FileAttributes
- AsHumanSize
- MediaType
- PartitionTypeName
- HexDump
- FixShortFile

The project taught us how to read and interpret raw data from disk images, understand file system structures, and navigate through complex file systems programmatically.

## [MemoryManager](https://github.com/aamindehkordi/CUI-Development-Operations/tree/main/Memory-Manager)

In this project, we have created a basic memory manager to practice memory management concepts. We have implemented memory allocation, deallocation, and efficient management with operations such as:

- init_memory_space
- allocate_memory
- eliminate_memory
- free_memory

This project allowed us to learn and practice important memory management techniques and understand the real-world implications of memory leaks and efficient memory utilization.

Throughout all three projects, the team has gained a deeper understanding of programming concepts and improved our problem-solving skills. The lessons learned span from foundational data structures like linked lists to complex file systems and memory management techniques.
